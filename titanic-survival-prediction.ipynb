It was from here during the early hours of 15 April 1912 that Titanic's lifeboats were lowered into the North Atlantic. The bridge and wheelhouse were at the forward end, in front of the captain's and officers' quarters. The bridge stood 8 feet (2.4 m) above the deck, extending out to either side so that the ship could be controlled while docking. The wheelhouse stood within the bridge. The entrance to the First Class Grand Staircase and gymnasium were located midships along with the raised roof of the First Class lounge, while at the rear of the deck were the roof of the First Class smoke room and the relatively modest Second Class entrance. The wood-covered deck was divided into four segregated promenades: for officers, First Class passengers, engineers, and Second Class passengers respectively. Lifeboats lined the side of the deck except in the First Class area, where there was a gap so that the view would not be spoiled.[18][19]\n\nThe promenade deck, sometimes known as a deck, ran the full 546 feet (166 m) of the superstructure. It included First Class cabins, the First Class lounge, a smoking room, reading and writing rooms, and Palm Court, all of which were designated for use by First Class guests alone.[18]\n   \n       The highest level of the hull and the top weight-bearing deck was the bridge deck, or B Deck. Here were additional First Class guest accommodations, including six magnificent staterooms (cabins) with separate private promenades. The à la carte restaurant and the Café Parisien on the Titanic offered First Class guests opulent dining experiences. Both were operated by chefs under contract and their employees, all of whom perished in the accident. The entry hall and Second Class smoking room were situated on this deck. The ship's elevated forecastle, which housed the anchor housings, various pieces of equipment, and Number 1 hatch (the main door leading to the cargo holds), was located ahead of the bridge deck.[c] Third Class passengers utilized the elevated poop deck, which was 32 meters (106 feet) long, as a promenade, situated aft of the bridge deck. As the Titanic sunk, many of its passengers and crew made their last stand there. Well decks kept the forecastle and poop deck apart from the bridge deck.[20][21]\n    \n    The uppermost deck that ran straight from bow to stern was the shelter deck, or C Deck. It included both well decks; the Third Class promenade used the forward deck. Below, there were crew cabins.Beneath the poop deck were the Third Class public rooms and the forecastle. The Second Class library and most First Class cabins were located in between.[20][22]\n    \n    The First Class dining saloon, First Class reception room, and Second Class dining saloon were the three huge public spaces that dominated D Deck, the saloon deck. Passengers in third class had an open space. This deck included accommodations for First, Second, and Third Class passengers, with fireman's sleepers situated in the bow. Strictly speaking, only eight of the fifteen watertight bulkheads on the ship reached this greatest level.[20][23]\n    \n    The top deck, or E Deck, had berths for chefs, seamen, stewards, and trimmers in addition to passenger accommodations for all three classes. Along with its length was a lengthy corridor known as \"Scotland Road,\" after a well-known Liverpool street. Both crew personnel and passengers traveling in third class utilized Scotland Road.[20][24]\n    \n    The middle deck, or F Deck, was the final fully finished deck and was mostly used by departments of the crew as well as guests traveling in Second and Third Class. This was the location of the Turkish bath, swimming pool, and kennels in addition to the Third Class dining saloon.[20][24][25]\n    \n    Located barely over the waterline, G Deck was the lowest passenger deck in its whole and had the lowest portholes. This was the location of the squash court as well as the traveling post office, where packages and letters were processed and ready for distribution upon ship docking. This area was also used to store food. Something interrupted the deck.by orlop (partial) decks over the engine, turbine, and boiler rooms at various locations.[20][26]\n    On the lowest level of the ship, below the waterline, were the orlop decks and the tank top below that. The tank top, or innermost part of the ship's hull, served as a platform for the boilers, engines, turbines, and electrical generators of the vessel, while the orlop decks were utilized as cargo areas. Passengers would not have been allowed to witness the engine and boiler rooms located in this section of the ship. There were flights of steps connecting them to the higher decks of the ship; twin spiral stairways in the bow led up to D Deck.[20][26]\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# creating the new column called all possible decks. \n\nconditions = [\n    (df2['Pclass'] == 1) & (df2['Deck'] == 'not available'),\n    ((df2['Deck'] == 'A') | (df2['Deck'] == 'B') | (df2['Deck'] == 'C') | (df2['Deck'] == 'D')),\n    (df2['Pclass'] == 2) & (df2['Deck'] == 'not available'),\n    ((df2['Deck'] == 'D') | (df2['Deck'] == 'E') | (df2['Deck'] == 'F')),\n    (df2['Pclass'] == 3) & (df2['Deck'] == 'not available'),\n    ((df2['Deck'] == 'D') | (df2['Deck'] == 'E') | (df2['Deck'] == 'F') | (df2['Deck'] == 'G'))]\n\nchoices = ['A/B/C/D', 'A/B/C/D', 'D/E/F', 'D/E/F', 'D/E/F/G', 'D/E/F/G']\n\ndf2['all possible Decks'] = np.select(conditions, choices, default=df2['Deck'])\n","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### *Adding a new column showing the number of people in that particular ticket and the cost per person ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# getting a new column with no of persons in that specified ticket \nvalue=df2['Ticket'].value_counts()\ndf2['persons_in_ticket']=df2['Ticket'].map(value)","metadata":{"scrolled":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"value","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# creating fare per person using persond per ticket \ndf2['fare per person']=df2['Fare']/df2['persons_in_ticket']","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# checking unique values in the column\ndf2['persons_in_ticket'].unique()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##### *create a travel category column ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# creating a new column called traveler actegory -- big family(5), small family(5), nuclear family(4,3), bi(2), solo(1), ","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# creating a new user defined function to apply on persond in ticket \ndef travel(x):\n    if x==1:\n        return 'solo'\n    elif x==2:\n        return 'bi'\n    elif (x==3) | (x==4):\n        return 'small family'\n    elif (x==5) | (x==6) |(x==7):\n        return 'large family'\n    \n    \ndf2['travelercategory']=df2['persons_in_ticket'].apply(travel)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### * CREATING A NEW AGE GROUP COLUMN ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"## Age group columns ","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df2['age group']=df1['Age'].apply(lambda x: 'infant' if 0<x<=2 else 'child' if 2<x<=16 \\\n                                  else 'youngadults' if 16<x<=30 else \\\n                                 'middleaged' if 30<x<=45 else 'oldadults' if 45<x<=60  \\\n                                  else 'seniorcitizens' if x>60  else 'notavailable' )","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# VISUALIZATION OF THE DATA ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df2_num=df2.select_dtypes(exclude=object)\ndf2_cat=df2.select_dtypes(include=object)\n","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df2_num","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(10,3))\nre=1\nfor i in df2_num.columns:\n    plt.subplot(2,4,re)\n    sns.kdeplot(df2[i], color='black')\n    plt.title(i)\n    re+=1\n    \nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()","metadata":{"scrolled":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(10,3))\nre=1\nfor i in df2_num.columns:\n    plt.subplot(2,4,re)\n    sns.boxplot(df2[i], color='black')\n    plt.title(i)\n    re+=1\n    \nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()","metadata":{"scrolled":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"The age, fare, persons per ticket, fare per person all has outliers.
